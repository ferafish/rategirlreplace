    "Nog": "This is your NO-GO ZONE. We do not hang around, and date, and marry women who are at least, in our mind, a 5. So, this is your no-go zone. You don't go here. You just rule this out. Life is better this way, that's the way it is.",
    "Fun":"Above a 5, and to about an 8, and below the crazy line - this is your FUN ZONE. You can hang around here, and meet these girls and spend time with them. Keep in mind, while you're in the fun zone, you want to move OUT of the fun zone to a more permanent location. These girls are most of the time not crazy.",
    "Dan":"Above the crazy line - it's the DANGER ZONE. This is redheads, strippers, anyone named Tiffany hairdressers... This is where your car gets keyed, you get bunny in the pot, your tires get slashed, and you wind up in jail.",
    "Dat":"Below the crazy line, above an 8 hot, but still about 7 crazy. This is your DATE ZONE. You can stay in the date zone indefinitely. These are the girls you introduce to your friends and your family. They're good looking, and they're reasonably not crazy most of the time. You can stay here indefinitely.",
    "Wif":"Above an 8 hot, and between about 7 and a 5 crazy - this is WIFE ZONE. If you meet this girl, you should consider long-term relationship. Rare.",
    "Tra":"You've met a girl she's above 8 hot, and not crazy at all (below 4)... totally cool? You should be careful. That's a snake. You're talking to a snake!",
    "Uni":"Below 5 crazy, and above 8 hot, this is the UNICORN ZONE, these things don't exist. If you find a unicorn, please capture it safely, keep it alive, we'd like to study it, and maybe look at how to replicate that."
